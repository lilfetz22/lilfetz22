<h1>Hi, I'm William Fetzner!👋 <br/><a href="https://github.com/lilfetz22">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-fetzner-480817269/">LinkedIn</a></h1> 

As a data scientist with nearly a decade of experience, I've honed my skills in analyzing complex datasets, creating impactful visualizations, and crafting compelling data narratives. My journey has taken me from optimizing safety stock at CVS to automating critical reports for Q-Centrix, always with an eye on delivering tangible business value.<br/>

I'm passionate about leveraging Python, SQL, and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Whether it's predicting rainfall patterns in North Carolina or analyzing sentiment on Reddit, I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable insights.
My background as an educator has sharpened my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly, a skill I've found invaluable when collaborating with cross-functional teams. From developing time-series models to crafting custom VS Code extensions, I'm always eager to expand my toolkit and tackle new challenges.<br/>

This portfolio showcases a selection of my professional and personal projects, demonstrating my versatility across industries and technologies. I invite you to explore my work and see how I can bring value to your data science initiatives.
